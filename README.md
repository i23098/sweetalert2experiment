## How to build

The build process uses the [gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) included. Simply execute:

```bash
gradlew build
```

This will generate a war file in the `build/libs/` that can be deployed for instance in [tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/).
